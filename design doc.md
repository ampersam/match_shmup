#The Game

A 'social' action rpg where daily life is conveyed through common action RPG tropes and social interactions are crafted from combinations of ideas.

#The Protagonist

A completely gender neutral character with a male or female sex chosen at character creation. 

The protagonist becomes characterized through the choices made in conversations and the skills chosen on the gender tree.

#The Gender Tree

The typical action RPG skill tree is replaced with a two-pronged gender tree dominated by the traditional gender binary. Between (and around) the two primary paths are a variety of trans-gender skills that represent many of the paths of gender identity. 

The skills will impact both the action gameplay and the social interactions.
